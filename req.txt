Balls, Buckets and Output Must be stored in Database
• Note:Every time a user requests the system to place balls in buckets by inputting
a quantity of balls to be placed, the empty volume of the bucket will get reduced after the placement
of the balls.
• Everytime user adds new bucket or ball or update existing bucket or ball, all buckets will get
emptied.
Following things are to be kept in mind while designing a system:
1) Every time the balls are placed in bucket, empty volume will be reduced by volume
of the balls placed inside the bucket
2) Partial placement must be made by the system, if all the balls are not possible to be placed inside
the buckets because of the lack of empty volume, then the maximum possible volume of the balls must
be placed.
3) After any placement, empty volume must not be less than zero, if no bucket satisfies this criteria,
no placement will be made and message will be shown.
4) Minimum number of the buckets must be used for balls placement
5) Wherever possible, in a single placement, system must utilize the single bucket to its maximum
empty volume.
6) Any ball of any color can go to any basket, all depending on the empty volume and other criteria
mentioned above.
7) Please comment wherever necessary and follow coding standards.
